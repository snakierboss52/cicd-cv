# CV - Automated Static website
### Content and requirements
Simple template to create my CV and deploy it in s3 as a static website with cloudfront and DNS implementation

### Requirements
Previous to start with this project we need to have some resources created to execute this project without any problems

* AWS Account
* A Domain Name (You can buy it where you preferred it)
* Bucket created in AWS S3 with the same name of your domain name
* Basic code HTML, profile image (If you want to add it), css file, and you can add js code to add more complexity to your template
* Basic worflow and job to run githu actions and update your cloud website automatically on every push (You can paste the same workflow what's here)

> :warning: If you buy your domain name in a site different to AWS Route53 you must configured the DNS servers changing this from your provider to route53 to make it more easier


### Architecture

We can see below the diagram related to this implementations, it's very simple.

We start using this repository as source code, then we create the worflow with a job that sync the files of the project to our s3 bucket in AWS, finally we execute the invalidation of paths in cloudfront to get the actual versi√≥n updated in our static website
